## Getting Started

The Dependencies for this jupyter-notebook are:
```
-Python3
-NumPy
-sklearn
-pandas
-keras
```

## Keras and Tensor Flow Implementations
The Keras model has different architecture from the one on Tensor Flow.

The Tensor Flow code has functionality for tensorboard.

To start the tensorboard type in terminal:
```
tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/digit_classifier_model
```
